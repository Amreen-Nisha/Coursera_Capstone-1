The reasons for moving cities varied from Wanting new or better home/apartment to new job/job transfer/other job related reasons. Also, Rober Half's survey shows that 62% of workers said they would relocate for a job. \n\nThe basis of this project is to help people compare the cities they're moving from and to, then recommend locations in their new cities by exploring venue-based city-to-city simialrity mearues, clustering neighborhoods within a city, looking at housing requirements and prices as well as crime rates.\n\nIn this project, I am going to use New York, NY and San Diego, CA as my two cities to demonstrate the methodology, which will then be able to be used for different cities. I am moving from New York, NY to San Diego, CA for a job, and interested in areas that meets the following criteria:\n\n- Similar to my current neighborhood, Chelsea, Manhattan(venues and mentities as in my current residence)\n- Have my preferred venue types\n- Have at least 2bed+ houses(preferrably 3bed+) that are affordable, my maximum budget is 1.5m\n- Safe enough to be able to walk around alone"
